                <p>
                    I am a graduate student at Marist College currently pursuing an M.S. in Information 
                    Systems with a dual concentration in Business Analytics and Information Systems Management. 
                    My passion lies in human-centric design, and with my background in software development, 
                    I possess an understanding of the essential elements required to transform design concepts 
                    into real code.
